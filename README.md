# redi.ly

This project is an experiment in creating a URL shortening service with Node.js and Redis.  It was conceived after reading through the excellent [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks) book by Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson.

To get started, install required modules.

	$ npm install
